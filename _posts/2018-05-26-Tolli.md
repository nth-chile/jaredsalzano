After the Tolli founders won Season 1 of TLC's Girl Starter, they began working to help artists connect and collaborate with each other.

I helped them to build a cross-platform app to match artists based on location and common interest. It's similar to a dating app, except instead of finding romance, you can find artists interested in collaborating with you on your next project.
