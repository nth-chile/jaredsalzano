  <div class="lyrics">
    A sad refrain as tears depart<br />
    A word remains that I can start<br />
    To map the borders of my heart<br />
    And change the channels that I chart<br />
<br />
    I’m not complete, but feel the heat<br />
    As pavement seals me to the street<br />
    Immobilized, I realized<br />
    Misjudged the situation’s size<br />
<br />
    Though seasons change and seeds may start<br />
    The beauty of a broken heart<br />
    Cannot be seen but in full view<br />
    The colors can come back to you<br />
<br />
    A love supreme, an ancient art<br />
    A finely tuned piano part<br />
    That plays its notes from stop to start<br />
    And hinges on a broken heart<br />
<br />
    Though seasons change and seeds may start<br />
    The beauty of a broken heart<br />
    Cannot be seen but in full view<br />
    The colors can come back to you<br />
<br />
    Effortlessly gliding down the spiral headed toward the ground<br />
    Of radiance arriving much too soon<br />
    Humbly acknowledging the thoughts inside increase my slide<br />
    The grade is what propels me to my room<br />
<br />
    Though seasons change and seeds may start<br />
    The beauty of a broken heart<br />
    Cannot be seen but in full view<br />
    The colors can come back to you<br />
<br />
    Though seasons change and seeds may start<br />
    The beauty of a broken heart<br />
    Cannot be seen but in full view<br />
    The colors can come back to you<br />
<br />
    Though seasons change and seeds may start<br />
    The beauty of a broken heart<br />
    Cannot be seen but in full view<br />
    The colors can come back to you<br />
