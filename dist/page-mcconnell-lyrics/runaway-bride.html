  <div class="lyrics">
    Sitting on a bus, holding her cross, wondering deep inside<br />
    Rolling through a field with some alamo steel, looking for a place to hide<br />
    She’s heading out west, but she can’t confess, and she’s hoping that she can find<br />
    A way to explain the cause of her pain and the shame that she left behind<br />
    Hoping someday she’ll learn to behave so that people don’t wonder just what’s gotten under her skin<br />
    <br />
    The satellite eyes of the runaway bride is all that is on TV<br />
    She’s counting the miles to forget for a while but she won’t take the test to see<br />
    The desert goes by with its elegant sky reaching for a silhouette peak<br />
    She’s got tears in her eyes, but before the ink dries, she’s hoping that she can speak<br />
    Hoping someday she’ll learn to explain so that people don’t wonder just what’s gotten under her skin<br />
    <br />
    What’s it about, you’re not ready yet?<br />
    If it’s in doubt, how far you gonna get?<br />
    Your ticket to ride has got you on the run<br />
    Ready or not, your future’s gonna come<br />
    <br />
    What’s it about, you’re not ready yet?<br />
