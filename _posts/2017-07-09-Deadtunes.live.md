<p class='bg'>I built a web app that streams the <a href='https://archive.org/' target='_blank'>Internet Archive's</a> live Grateful Dead archive.</p>

Deadtunes is a single-page application that implements an MVC pattern written in JavaScript/jQuery.

I took an unnecessary step that allowed me to learn how to build a MongoDB database and query it from server-side JavaScript. I wrote a script that iterates through the items in the Archive database, extracting the relevant data and inserting it into a MongoDB database.

{{slide['start']}}

Then, I used Express JS to build a RESTful API so that, for instance, `http://deadtunes.live/api/1975-08-13` returns a JSON response including relevant data about the recordings of each song the Grateful Dead played on August 13, 1975.

{{slide['start']}}

When the user selects a year, date or track, the client-side code looks at the URL hash and uses it to query the API and update the DOM. Voila, a SPA.
